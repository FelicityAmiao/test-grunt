run this:
```
grunt
```
you will got a packaged project with html/js/css same with the code you write.

which can help:
1. zip the file to be smaller;
2. move specifed files to a directly, which help to specify access by web browser for safety reason, such as web server like Express.js.

then access the html file in browser by double clicked it:)
